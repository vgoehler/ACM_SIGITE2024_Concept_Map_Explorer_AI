**Analyzing Concept Maps in Computer Science Education: An
Unsupervised Learning Approach with Graph Neural Networks**

**Abstract of Paper:**
It is of paramount importance for teachers to comprehend the knowledge acquired by their students in order to validate their teaching methods and ensure accuracy. Concept maps (CMs), which graphically represent knowledge, are effective tools for visualising learning and tracking progress. However, interpreting CMs is challenging due to their complexity and the multitude of interconnected concepts.

To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised learning methodology leveraging graph neural networks—specifically Node2Vec and GraphSAGE—to analyze CMs autonomously.

Our preliminary results demonstrate the potential of the method to automatically identify clusters and relationships within CMs,thereby reducing manual analysis effort. Using this approach, we identified ten clusters of subgraphs within our dataset consisting of the eight most recent CMs.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel application of unsupervised learning in the analysis of concept maps, aiming to enhance educational practices by providing scalable and insightful methods for understanding student knowledge representations.
